  <h2>Jose Castro</h2>
  <h3></h3>
  <p>Hi, my name is Jose, I’m originally from Ecuador, but I currently live in Sandy, Utah with my wife and our 8-month-old son. I’ve been happily married for almost 6 years, and honestly, my wife and son are my biggest motivation—they’re the reason I keep pushing forward, even when life gets busy or tough.</p>
    
  <p>I recently earned my Associate’s degree in Business Management, and I decided to continue my education by pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Web Design and Development (WDD) here at BYU-Idaho. My goal is to transition into a career in web development, combining both the creative and logical sides of my personality to build tools, websites, and digital solutions that can help people.</p>
    
  <p>Some of the things I love doing in my free time include drawing, writing stories, and working on personal projects—especially ones that involve technology and creativity. I also enjoy cooking with the air fryer, keeping up with tech trends, and brainstorming side hustle ideas that might one day turn into something bigger.</p>
    
  <p>Right now, I’m balancing school with work and family life. Pursuing this degree is a step toward a career change—one that gives me the flexibility and potential to create something of my own in the future.</p>
    
  <p>One of the things I love most about BYU-Idaho is the way it combines spiritual values with professional learning. The community here is supportive, and I appreciate how faith is integrated into the learning experience.</p>
    
  <p>This course is especially exciting because web development is a skill I’ve wanted to learn for a long time. I see a lot of opportunities in tech, and I believe learning how to design and build websites will help me create projects for others, build a career, and even support my family in new ways.</p>
    
  <p>I’ve been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my whole life. One of my favorite quotes comes from President Russell M. Nelson:</p>
    
  <p>“The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.”</p>
    
  <p>My favorite scripture is Mosiah 2:17:</p>
    
  <p>"When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."</p>

  <p>It reminds me that every skill I learn can be used to serve others, whether it’s helping someone build a website or just being a dependable husband and father.<p>
    
  <p>I’m excited to keep learning, grow my skills, and connect with others in this class. I believe this journey will bless my family and give me the tools to make a difference—both spiritually and professionally.</p>
